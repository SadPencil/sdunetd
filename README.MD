## Installation on OpenWRT

1. Copy the executable to `/usr/bin`, and rename it to `srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client`

  - Note: You MUST choose proper builds according to `/proc/cpuinfo`.

  - Note: It might take a few minutes to copy a large file.

  - Note: If the static builds are too large for a tiny ROM, you can either use `upx` to compress the executeable, or compiles by yourself with environment variable `CGO_ENABLED=1`, which relys on `libc`.

2. `chmod +x /usr/bin/srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client`

3. `touch /etc/init.d/srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client`

4. `chmod +x /etc/init.d/srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client`

5. `vi /etc/init.d/srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client`

```shell
#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common 

START=60
 
start() { 
/usr/bin/srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client -s SERVER_IP -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -log /tmp/srun3000-sdu-qingdao.log &
} 

stop() { 
killall srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client
}
```

Replace `SERVER_IP` `USERNAME` `PASSWORD` with real ones.

6. `/etc/init.d/srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client enable`
7. `/etc/init.d/srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client start`

## Installation on Linux (based on systemd)
- Step 1 to 4 is the same with last section.

5. `vi /etc/systemd/system/srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client.service`

```ini
[Unit]
Description=srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client
After=network.target
Wants=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
PrivateTmp=true
ExecStart=/usr/bin/srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client -s SERVER_IP -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -log /tmp/srun3000-sdu-qingdao.log
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace `SERVER_IP` `USERNAME` `PASSWORD` with real ones.

6. `systemctl daemon-reload`
7. `systemctl enable srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client`
8. `systemctl start srun3000-sdu-qingdao-client`

## Installation on Windows
Although it is okay to create a shortcut at `startup` folder, it is better to create a service. `srvany` is a 32-bit program provided by Microsoft to let any program becomes a service, and you can get a 64-bit implementation at repo [ariscop/srvany](https://github.com/ariscop/srvany).
Details about how to make it as a service is available here. [Chinese version]https://www.pencillab.cn/archives/73.html
